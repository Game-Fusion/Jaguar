# Jaguar

## Less is more

Jaguar eschews a modern day GUI in favour of a simple approach: games, and games only. And it does an excellent job with games, too; every Jaguar game comes in a bundle, along with a full manual which is pages long and handwritten on a per-game basis. By having nothing but what it needs to, it also allows a more refreshingly retro gaming experience.

## Open platform

Jaguar is a totally open platform. You need no licensing or permissions to develop for Jaguar - make something, tell Game Fusion you've made something, and it's ready for retail - no questions asked. 

Jaguar also allows for developers to use their very own APIs with more convenience. With Jaguar, developers are allowed to copy their APIs to /apis/ for easy access. This not only removes reliance on loading APIs from the disk all the time, but it allows other games to use preinstalled APIs to save disk space.

### (Re)Launching soon.
